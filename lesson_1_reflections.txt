
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  Show me which lines contain bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Check what previous programmers (or me in the past) wanted to put in the
    programme. Knowledge about what I used and knew in the past.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you decide when to create a commit and have decription of it.
    Cons: you have to remember about creating commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think Google Docs doesn't understand any connections between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all history of the file
    git diff compares two versions of file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because using version control system, I can always return to one of the
    previous versions of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to use Git for fast editing my programs without fear about
    errors.
